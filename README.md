# Jose Elera's Vim Portable Setup

## Description
This one is meant to be copied into a USB flash drive, with any requirements
other than Vim 7.3+ compiled with huge features.

Look at my [vimconfig](https://github.com/jelera/vimconfig), for a more
featureful Vim setup.

## Tested
- Mac OSX
- Ubuntu 12.04 / 14.04
- CentOS / Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
- Debian GNU/Linux

## Plugins
See the `bundle` directory for 3rd-party plugins

## Disclaimer
You are welcome to take a look at my `.vimrc` and take ideas on how to customize
your Vim experience; though I encourage you to experiment with your own
mappings, plugins and configs.
